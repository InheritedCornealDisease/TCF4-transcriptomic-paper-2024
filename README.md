- [Differential exon usage](/DEXSeq_analysis) results from bulk RNASeq data of three sample cohorts, discussed in the section on differential *TCF4* exon usage and presented in **Figure 3**  
- [Rare variant analysis](/CoCoRV_gene_burden_analysis) results on rare *TCF4* variants identified within the CTG18.1 expansion-negative cohort, presented in **Table 3**
